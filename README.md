# AI-Agents
This repository have the code of different agent I have made during my learning phase. 
Here are the brief about the agents I have made : 
1. Built my first agent using Gemini and ADK.
2. Built my first multi-agent systems using ADK.
3. Explored new ways to add tools to extend what agents can do.
4. Explored best practices for tools, including using MCP and long-running operations.
5. Built stateful agents and perform context engineering.
6. Explored how to use memory with the agents
7. Implemented observability to help debugging agents.
8. Evaluated the agents
9.  Explored how to use A2A Protocol to have agents interact with each other.
10.  Deployd agent to Agent Engine on Google Cloud.
